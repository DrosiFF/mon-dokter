## Test Data Isolation Between Providers

### **Setup Test Scenario:**

1. **Create 2 Test Providers:**
   - Provider A: Dr. Smith (Victoria Medical Center)
   - Provider B: Dr. Johnson (Praslin Health Clinic)

2. **Create Test Services:**
   - Provider A: General Consultation (‚Ç¨75)
   - Provider B: Dental Cleaning (‚Ç¨90)

3. **Create Test Bookings:**
   - Patient X books with Provider A
   - Patient Y books with Provider B

### **Privacy Tests to Run:**

#### **Test 1: Provider Dashboard Isolation**
‚úÖ **Expected:** Provider A can only see their own bookings
‚úÖ **Expected:** Provider A cannot see Provider B's bookings
‚úÖ **Expected:** Provider A can only see their own services

**How to Test:**
1. Login as Provider A ‚Üí Go to `/provider-dashboard`
2. Check bookings tab ‚Üí Should only show Patient X's booking
3. Check services tab ‚Üí Should only show General Consultation
4. Login as Provider B ‚Üí Should only see their own data

#### **Test 2: API Endpoint Security**
‚úÖ **Expected:** `/api/provider/bookings` returns only own bookings
‚úÖ **Expected:** `/api/provider/services` returns only own services
‚úÖ **Expected:** Cannot access other provider's data via API

**How to Test:**
1. Login as Provider A
2. Check browser Network tab
3. API calls should only return Provider A's data
4. Try manually calling API with Provider B's ID ‚Üí Should fail

#### **Test 3: Admin View Privacy**
‚úÖ **Expected:** Admin can see all data but patient names are anonymized
‚úÖ **Expected:** Admin sees "J***" instead of "John Doe"
‚úÖ **Expected:** Admin can manage all providers but respects privacy

**How to Test:**
1. Login as Admin ‚Üí Go to `/admin/clinics`
2. Click "View" on any clinic
3. Recent bookings should show "J***" not full names
4. Admin can see statistics but not sensitive patient info

#### **Test 4: Cross-Clinic Privacy**
‚úÖ **Expected:** Victoria Medical Center cannot see Praslin Health Clinic data
‚úÖ **Expected:** Each clinic's providers only see their clinic's information
‚úÖ **Expected:** Booking data is isolated by provider, not shared across clinic

### **Security Checklist:**

- [ ] Provider A cannot see Provider B's bookings
- [ ] Provider A cannot modify Provider B's services
- [ ] Patient names are anonymized in admin view
- [ ] API endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Cross-clinic data is properly isolated
- [ ] Only admins can access admin endpoints
- [ ] Providers cannot access admin functions

### **Privacy Violations to Watch For:**

‚ùå **NEVER ALLOW:**
- Provider seeing other provider's patient data

‚úÖ **ALWAYS ENSURE:**

### **Emergency Privacy Response:**

If privacy violation is discovered:
1. **Immediately disable** the affected endpoint
2. **Check logs** for any unauthorized access
3. **Notify affected users** if needed
4. **Fix the security issue** before re-enabling
5. **Update tests** to prevent regression
